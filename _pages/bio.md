Previously, I worked with Frans de Waal at the [Living Links Center for the Advanced Study of Ape and Human Evolution](http://emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS). While there, I managed three groups of chimpanzees and conducted behavioural tests of their social cognition as well as observational studies.
 
I earned a BS in Psychology for an experimental study on the understanding of discrete probabilities in chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, and gorillas, which I carried out at the Wolfgang Köhler Primate Research Center in Leipzig, Germany. I took an opportunity to work in the field for a year as well—as a research assistant on the Inkawu Vervet Project in South Africa, which focused on different aspects of vervet monkey behaviour, including social learning and inter-group encounters.
