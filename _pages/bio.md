I earned my PhD in Psychology / Cognitive Sciences from Georgia State University, studying decision-making biases in capuchin monkeys, rhesus macaques, and humans in the Laboratory for Comparative Economics and Behavioral Studies ([CEBUS Lab](http://www.sarah-brosnan.com/lab)).

Through a broad network of collaborations, I have also explored a wider range of topics in cognitive psychology, with a particular focus on primate cognition (for example, the [ManyPrimates](https://manyprimates.github.io/) project), but also including, problem-solving in zoo-housed reptiles; cross-cultural developmental field research in Manipur, India; information neglect in judicial and policy decisions; and more.
