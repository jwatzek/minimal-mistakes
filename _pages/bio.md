I'm a PhD candidate in the Cognitive Sciences programme at Georgia State University. I mainly work with Sarah Brosnan at the Laboratory for Comparative Economics and Behavioral Studies ([CEBUS Lab](http://www.sarah-brosnan.com/lab)), studying decision-making in capuchin monkeys, rhesus macaques, and humans. I earned a MA in Psychology / Cognitive Sciences investigating how seemingly irrational behavior can be optimal in uncertain environments.

Through a collaboration with Joe Mendelson, I also run cognitive tests with reptiles at Zoo Atlanta. And in Fall 2018, I will be conducting fieldwork with kids in Bihar, India as a visiting research scholar in the Evolution, Variation, and Ontogeny of Learning Laboratory ([EVO Learn Lab](http://www.cristinelegare.com/lab/)) led by Cristine Legare at the University of Texas at Austin.

Previously, I worked with Frans de Waal at the [Living Links Center for the Advanced Study of Ape and Human Evolution](http://emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS). While there, I managed three groups of chimpanzees and conducted behavioural tests of their social cognition as well as observational studies.
 
I earned a BS in Psychology for an experimental study on the understanding of discrete probabilities in chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, and gorillas, which I carried out at the [Wolfgang Köhler Primate Research Center](http://wkprc.eva.mpg.de/english/index.htm) in Leipzig, Germany. I took an opportunity to work in the field for a year as well — as a research assistant on the Inkawu Vervet Project in South Africa, which focused on different aspects of vervet monkey behaviour, including social learning and inter-group encounters.
