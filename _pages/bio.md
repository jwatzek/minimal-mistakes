I'm a PhD candidate in the Cognitive Sciences programme at Georgia State University. I work with Sarah Brosnan at the Comparative Economics and Behavioral Studies Lab ([CEBUS Lab](http://www.sarah-brosnan.com/lab)) and with Eyal Aharoni at the Cooperation, Conflict, & Cognition Lab ([CCC Lab](http://www.aharonilab.com)). I earned a MA in Psychology / Cognitive Sciences investigating how seemingly irrational behavior can be optimal in uncertain environments.

Previously, I worked with Frans de Waal at the [Living Links Center for the Advanced Study of Ape and Human Evolution](http://emory.edu/LIVING_LINKS). While there, I managed three groups of chimpanzees and conducted behavioural tests of their social cognition as well as observational studies.
 
I earned a BS in Psychology for an experimental study on the understanding of discrete probabilities in chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, and gorillas, which I carried out at the [Wolfgang Köhler Primate Research Center](http://wkprc.eva.mpg.de/english/index.htm) in Leipzig, Germany. I took an opportunity to work in the field for a year as well—as a research assistant on the Inkawu Vervet Project in South Africa, which focused on different aspects of vervet monkey behaviour, including social learning and inter-group encounters.
