    excerpt: "My research focuses on how animals and humans make adaptive decisions in uncertain environments. In particular, I'm interested in understanding decision-making biases and seemingly irrational behavior in the context of an individual's physical and social environment. "

    excerpt: "At Georgia State, I taught *Intro to* and *Advanced Research Design & Analysis*, *Intro to General Psychology*, and guest lectured on a range of topics in courses such as *Psychology of Animal Behavior* and *Primate Models of Human Behavior*.<br/><br/>
    Previously, I taught *Statistics for Psychologists* and *Intro to R programming* and have run workshops to teach R and Python for data wrangling and visualization, stimulus presentation, and mathematical simulations."

    title: "Code"
    excerpt: "My languages of choice are R and Python for all things data science, but I find my way around Matlab and SAS as well. I use LaTeX for typesetting and the usual suspects for web development. <br/><br/>Recently, I've been learning Java and XML for Android mobile development. A recent project is WhatsOb, an Android app for behavioral observations."
intro:
  - excerpt: "<strong>I am a data scientist driven to make sense of why people do what they do and to figure out how we can make better decisions.</strong><br/><br/>
  In the past, this led me to the fields of psychology and cognitive science, where I earned my PhD studying why, when, and how humans and other primates make irrational decisions. I transitioned to a data career in industry to have a more direct impact on people's day-to-day lives. As a data science fellow at Insight, I consulted with the social media startup Stacks to build them an end-to-end recommender system that helps users more easily connect with each other on the app and find content that they'll love.<br/><br/>
Currently, I'm extremely excited to use this drive and my skills as a data scientist at Audible to empower listeners to find relevant content that they care about and to help them get the most out of the catalog.<br/><br/>[<i class='fa fa-pencil'></i> Email me](mailto:hello@juliawatzek.com){: .btn}"
