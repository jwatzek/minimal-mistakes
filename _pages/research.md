For my master's, I study how seemingly irrational behaviour is optimal under certain conditions, leading to maximum benefits over costs. I'm comparing such illogical behaviour in several primate species (humans, capuchin monkeys, and rhesus monkeys). Another line of work explores the role of social relationships and unequal outcomes on cooperation in groups of capuchin monkeys.
